## Download Latest Release
https://github.com/SCTCoding/EnterpriseAdmin/releases/tag/v1.1

## Usage Options
- Execute Policy Helper from a JAMF policy
- Execute Policy Helper from a local installer (sort of a policy installer)

## Plist
The plist needs to have the name: com.sctcoding.policyhelper.plist
If you change the name be sure you edit the code as well. For now this is hard coded. All key values in the plist are hard coded.

## Notice
This works with one policy at a time only! I have not tested with more than one at a time. I have no idea what will happen likely some form of doom and gloom.
